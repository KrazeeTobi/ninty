LOS ANGELES, MAY 11, 2004 - Some look at video games and remain content with the 
way things are. Nintendo dreams of things and asks, &quot;Why not?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
For 15 years Nintendoﾕs Game Boy&reg; line has dominated the hand-held video game 
market. But today at the Electronics Entertainment Expo (E&sup3;), the new Nintendo 
DS creates a whole new category by radically altering the way people will play 
games. Nintendo DS remains on track to launch in Japan and North America before 
the end of the year, and in Europe the system will launch during the first quarter 
of 2005.<BR>
<BR>
With its two screens, Nintendo DS instantly shows its innovative face. But capabilities 
like a touch-screen input, voice recognition and wireless communication set it 
apart from every other game device, and again demonstrate Nintendo's passion for 
groundbreaking originality.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;When Nintendo came down and presented the DS platform to us, I think everyone 
was in shock,&quot; says Will Kassoy, Activision's vice president of global brand 
management. &quot;It was amazing. Our technical guys were drooling at the abilities 
and wanting so much to dive into programming for the system.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Aptly code-named Nintendo DS, this &quot;Developers' System&quot; provides developers 
a newfound canvas not only to create new games today, but also shape the future 
of the entire industry. Developers - and the public - need only use their imagination 
to see how the DS promises to transform the portable game industry by changing 
the way gamers relate to their games - and each other. Two screens offer two perspectives 
on the action at once. The touch screen could make accessing items, moving characters 
or navigating menus as easy as a tap or drag on the screen. Voice recognition 
could let players simply tell the game what they want it to do. Chat software 
will let users transmit text messages, handwriting and even drawings to one another. 
And wireless functions could link players in the same room - or across the country.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;This has a huge potential,&quot;says Yoichi Haraguchi, Namco's vice president 
and executive officer. &quot;It is very nice that we can create games using DS 
that were not even possible before.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Nintendo DS also will include two processors, 3-D capabilities on both screens, 
16-channel sound and a rechargeable battery that features a low-energy-consumption 
design. One media bay handles new DS game cartridges that hold one gigabit of 
information and more. The second media port allows for compatibility with Game 
Boy&reg; Advance games, as well as a host of possible future accessories.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;While others plan to let you go a little faster down the same roads you 
have always traveled, Nintendo plans to take you down incredible avenues youﾕve 
never seen before,&quot;explains Reggie Fils-Aime, Nintendo of Americaﾕs executive 
vice president, sales and marketing. &quot;We understand the hand-held market 
better than anyone else, and Nintendo DS paves a new path of originality and success.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Indeed, Nintendo invented and perfected the hand-held video game market with its 
unrivaled Game Boy line. And Nintendo has always been known for introducing innovations 
that radically reinvent the industry. It was the first company to install ports 
for four controllers, the first to create a rumble pack, the first to move from 
joysticks to modern controllers and the first to enable characters to roam freely 
in true 3-D environments. The unique features of the Nintendo DS build on that 
tradition and hold a wellspring of potential for the future. Game players will 
be wowed.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Once again Nintendo is taking another leap by providing totally new game-play 
experiences,&quot; says Jay Cohen, Ubisoft's vice president of publishing. &quot;Very 
characteristic of a Nintendo maneuver.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
More than 100 companies worldwide have received software development kits and 
are planning games for Nintendo DS. Games in development by Nintendo include a 
new Super Mario game, a Metroid&reg; game, a WarioWare game and PictoChat, software 
that lets players send instant text and picture messages. Third-party publishers 
also have announced games in development, including a Spider-Man&#8482; 2 title 
from Activision, a Rayman&reg; game from Ubisoft, a SpongeBob SquarePants&#8482; 
title from THQ, a Yu-Gi-Oh!&#8482; game from Konami, a Sonic title from Sega, 
a Bomberman game from Hudson Soft, a Need for Speed&#8482; game from Electronic 
Arts and a Pac-Man&#8482;title from Namco.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;THQ has been a strong supporter of Nintendo's hand-held systems over the 
years, and with great success,&quot; said Peter Dille, senior vice president of 
worldwide marketing, THQ. &quot;We look forward to the many innovations they are 
planning for the DS.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
The system's official name, price and launch lineup will be announced at a later 
date.<BR>
