              BETWEEN CORE AND CASUAL PLAYERS</DIV>
            <DIV STYLE="font-size:smaller; padding:3px; border-top:solid 1px #666666; border-bottom:solid 1px #666666;">From Wii Fit to Flash Focus to Mario Kart, Nintendo Shows Everyone is a Gamer</DIV>
          </DIV>
          <DIV CLASS="mainTxt"> SANTA MONICA, Calif., July 11, 2007 - The world used to be divided into two camps: gamers and non-gamers. In the first group: young men. In the second: everyone else.<BR>
            <BR>
            &nbsp; Then came Wii<SUP>TM</SUP> and Nintendo DS<SUP>TM</SUP>.<BR>
            <BR>
            &nbsp; The remarkable Wii Remote<SUP>TM</SUP> and touch screen and voice recognition of Nintendo DS removed the barriers to entry and put video games into the hands of young women, moms, dads and grandparents. Gamers now find they have a whole new population of people willing to join them in their gaming passion. At its media briefing today at the E3 Media &amp; Business Summit in Santa Monica, Calif., Nintendo announced multiple new games and accessories designed to reinforce that bridge and further demonstrate everyone is a gamer.<BR>
            <BR>
            &nbsp; &quot;Games like <I>Wii Sports</I> and the original <I>Brain Age</I> proved anyone can pick up a video game system and immediately have fun,&quot; says Nintendo of America President Reggie Fils-Aime. &quot;We're building on that foundation with games and accessories appealing to our current fan base and drawing in even more new players.&quot;<BR>
            <BR>
            &nbsp; New games and accessories not only demonstrate that Nintendo is not going to coast on its momentum, but they also show how the power and versatility of Nintendo's systems have only just begun to be explored. What might the future bring? These are the kinds of &quot;what-if&quot; questions firing the imaginations of consumers when Nintendo dares to explore them. For now, the following is a roundup of Nintendo's major announcements.<BR>
